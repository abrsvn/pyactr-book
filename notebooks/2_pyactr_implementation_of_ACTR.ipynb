    "One of the main ways in which this book is different from many other texts in linguistics is its hands-on approach to modeling: we will not only discuss and characterize theoretical claims and language models; we will also implement these models in Python3, making extensive use of the ACT-R package ```pyactr```, and we will see what the implemented models predict, down to very specific and fine-grained quantitative details.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ACT-R theory has been implemented in several programming languages, including Lisp (the `official' implementation), Java (jACT-R, Java ACT-R), Swift (PRIM) and Python2 (ccm). In this book, we will use a novel Python3 implementation: ```pyactr```. This implementation is very close to the official implementation in Lisp, so once you learn it you should be able to fairly easily transfer your newly acquired skills to Lisp ACT-R, if you are so inclined."
