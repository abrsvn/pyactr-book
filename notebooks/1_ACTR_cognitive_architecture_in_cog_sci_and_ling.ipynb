    "Adaptive Control of Thought -- Rational (ACT-R, pronounced like the verb 'act' followed by the letter 'r') is a cognitive architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'Control of thought' is used here in a descriptive way, similar to the sense of 'control' in the notion of 'control flow' in imperative programming languages: it determines the order in which programming statements -- or cognitive actions -- are executed / evaluated, and thus captures essential properties of an algorithm and its specific implementation in a program -- or a cognitive system. 'Control of thought' is definitely not used in a prescriptive way roughly equivalent to 'mind control' / indoctrination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cognitive architectures are commonly used in cognitive science to integrate empirical results into a unified cognitive framework, which establishes their consistency and provides a comprehensive formal foundation for future research. They are also used to make fully explicit and compute predictions of abstract and complex theoretical claims. For the same reasons, using a cognitive architecture can be very useful for the working linguist and psycholinguist. This book shows how the ACT-R cognitive architecture can be used to shed light on the cognitive mechanisms underlying a variety of linguistic phenomena, and to quantitatively and qualitatively capture the behavioral patterns observed in a variety of psycholinguistic tasks."

    "The term 'cognitive architecture' was first introduced by **Bell, C Gordon, and Allen Newell. 1971. *Computer Structures: Readings and Examples*. New York: McGraw-Hill**. A cognitive architecture specifies the general structure of the human mind at a level of abstraction that is sufficient to capture how the mind achieves its goals. Various cognitive architectures exist. They differ in many respects, but their defining characteristic is the level of abstractness that the architecture presupposes. As John R. Anderson, the founder of ACT-R, puts it:\n",
    "\n",
    "> In science, choosing the best level of abstraction for developing a theory is a strategic decision. In the case of connectionist elements or symbolic structures in ACT-R, the question is which level will provide the best bridge between brain and mind [...]. In both cases, the units are a significant abstraction from neurons and real brain processes, but the gap is probably smaller from the connectionist units to the brain. Similarly, in both cases the units are a significant distance from functions of the mind, but probably the gap is smaller in the case of ACT-R units. In both cases, the units are being proposed to provide a useful island to support a bridge from brain to mind. The same level of description might not be best for all applications. Connectionist models have enjoyed their greatest success in describing perceptual processing, while ACT-R models have enjoyed their greatest success in describing higher level processes such as equation solving. [...] I believe ACT-R has found the best level of abstraction for understanding those aspects of the human mind that separate it from the minds of other species.\n",

    "If nothing else, the preceding quote should sound intriguing to a theoretical linguist or psycholinguist, who often works on higher-level processes involved in language production or comprehension and the competence-level representations that these processes operate on. Thus, theoretical linguists and psycholinguists are likely to see ACT-R as providing the right level of abstraction for their  scientific enterprise. We hope that this book will provide enough details to show that this is not just an empty promise: ACT-R can be enlightening in formalizing theoretical linguistic claims, and making precise the ways in which these claims connect to processing mechanisms underlying linguistic behavior."

    "But being intrigued by the idea of cognitive architectures is not enough to justify why cognitive scientists in general, and linguists in particular, should care about cognitive architectures in their daily research. A better justification is that linguistics is part of the larger field of cognitive science, where _process_ models of the kind cognitive architectures enable us to formulate are the proper scientific target to aim for. The term 'process models' is taken from chapter 1 of **Lewandowsky, S., and S. Farrell. 2010. *Computational Modeling in Cognition: Principles and Practice*. Thousand Oaks, CA, USA: SAGE Publications**, who discuss why this type of models -- roughly, models of human language performance -- provide a higher scientific standard in cognitive science than _characterization_ models -- roughly, models of human language competence. Both process and characterization models are better than simply _descriptive_ models,"

Although those models themselves have no psychological content, they may well have compelling psychological implications. [In contrast, both characterization and process models] seek to illuminate the workings of the mind, rather than data, but do so to a greatly varying extent. Models that characterize processes identify and measure cognitive stages, but they are neutral with respect to the exact mechanics of those stages. [Process] models, by contrast, describe all cognitive processes in great detail and leave nothing within their scope unspecified.\n",

Do we want to describe data? Do we want to identify and characterize broad stages of processing? Do we want to explain how exactly a set of postulated cognitive processes interact to produce the behavior of interest?\n",

    "However, there is a more basic reason why linguists should consider process / performance models -- and the cognitive architectures that enable us to formulate them -- in addition to and at the same time as characterization / competence models. The reason is that _a priori_, we cannot know whether the best analysis of a linguistic phenomenon is exclusively a matter of competence or performance or both, in much the same way that we do not know in advance whether certain phenomena are best analyzed in syntactic terms or semantic terms or both.\n",
