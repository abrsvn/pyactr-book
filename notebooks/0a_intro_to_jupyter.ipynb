    "\n",
    "1. Jupyter is open source ('free as in speech') and free ('free as in beer'), just like Python\n",
    "    - it is not owned by any one person or company\n",
    "    - scientists and other programmers devote their time to improving Jupyter\n",
    "    - the code is readable by anyone, which means it is easier to catch bugs\n",
    "    - there is a large, thriving user base, so it's reliable\n",
    "2. Jupyter works with several different programming languages including R, Python, Matlab and others\n",
    "3. Jupyter runs in a standard web browser. \n",
    "4. Jupyter has many extensions that provide interactive widgets, animations, beautiful graphics, etc.\n",
    "5. Companies use Jupyter internally, and are looking to hire people with this skill.\n",
