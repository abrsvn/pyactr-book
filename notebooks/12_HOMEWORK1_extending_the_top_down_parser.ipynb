    "## Homework 1: extending the grammar and the top-down parser\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider extending our grammar and the top-down parser with intransitive verbs like _sleeps_, as well as sentential-complement taking verbs like _believe_.  That is, add the following phrase-structure and lexical-insertion rules to the grammar:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{array}[t]{lcl}\n",
    "        \\mbox{VP}&\\rightarrow&\\mbox{V}\\\\\n",
    "        \\mbox{VP}&\\rightarrow&\\mbox{V } \\mbox{CP}\\\\\n",
    "        \\mbox{CP}&\\rightarrow&\\mbox{C } \\mbox{S}\\\\\n",
    "        \\mbox{V}&\\rightarrow&\\mbox{sleeps}\\\\\n",
    "        \\mbox{V}&\\rightarrow&\\mbox{believes}\\\\\n",
    "        \\mbox{C}&\\rightarrow&\\mbox{that}\n",
    "\\end{array}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the new lexical items to declarative memory and add new production rules to procedural memory to encode the new phrase-structure rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your model is in place, parse the sentence _Mary believes that Bill sleeps_.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can probably already see that the new parser might run into problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the parser might get stuck when parsing the target sentence _Mary believes that Bill sleeps_ if it decides to\n",
    "\n",
    "- expand the first (matrix-clause) VP into V and NP, i.e., if it incorrectly expects a transitive verb instead of a sentential-complement taking verb\n",
    "- or expand that same VP into just V, i.e., if it incorrectly expects an intransitive verb.\n",
    "\n",
    "As already discussed, this is a typical issue with top-down parsing: categories and structures are hypothesized / predicted before seeing any evidence for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The extended top-down parser has several ways to expand VPs and it fails to parse the input if it uses a VP expansion rule that happens to be incompatible with the sentence to be parsed."
