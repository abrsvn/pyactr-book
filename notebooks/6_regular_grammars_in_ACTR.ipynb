    "Regular grammars can be classified into right-regular and left-regular grammars. Right-regular grammars are grammars whose rules are of the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "- X $\\rightarrow$ a Y (where a is a terminal and X, Y are non-terminals)\n",
    "- X $\\rightarrow$ a (where a is a terminal and X is a non-terminal)\n",
    "- X $\\rightarrow$ $\\epsilon$ (where $\\epsilon$ is the empty string and X is a non-terminal)\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the right-hand side of all production rules is constrained so that non-terminal symbols can only occur in the second position / on the right. Right-regular grammars are famously not expressive enough for natural languages (**Chomsky, Noam. 1956. Three models for the description of language. _IEEE Transactions on\n",
    "information theory_ 2:113â€“124**), but they make for a good introductory example of modeling basic linguistic patterns in ACT-R.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us implement a right-regular grammar in ACT-R, which will generate NP (noun phrase) constituents consisting of indefinitely long strings of nouns. We will represent nouns with the terminal symbol 'N'. We effectively restrict ourselves to one rule. This rule is of the form NP $\\rightarrow$ N NP. That is, every run of the model will generate an NP consisting of a potentially infinite number of Ns.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need only one chunk type -- ```goal_chunk``` on line 2 below -- encoding the rule NP (```mother```) $\\rightarrow$ N (```daughter1```) NP (```daughter2```). In addition to these three slots, this chunk type has a fourth slot ```state```, which will enable us to toggle between printing the value of ```daughter1``` and applying the `NP $\\rightarrow$ N NP' rule recursively to the NP in the ```daughter2``` slot."
