Before we delve into the models, we should point out that none of these models is necessarily cognitively realistic or plausible. We simply present them here to solidify the reader's knowledge of the concepts introduced in this chapter.

The dynamics of cognition: An ACT-R model of cognitive arithmetic. _Kognitionswissenschaft_ 8:5â€“19**). However, our simple model does not have this ambitious goal.

    "Recall that rules are conditionalized actions and ```==>``` separates preconditions from actions. In this rule, the preconditions simply state that the goal buffer must have a chunk that has no value for the slot ```count```. Furthermore, the slot ```start``` has the value ```=x``` (since ```=x``` does not appear anywhere in preconditions, this is trivially satisfied). As for the actions, the rule specifies changes in two buffers: the goal buffer (lines 7--9) and the retrieval buffer (lines 10--12). The ACT-R model will change the value of the slot ```count``` to the value assigned to the variable ```=x```. This means that the value of the ```count``` slot in the goal buffer will be matched to the value of the ```start``` slot. Second, we place a retrieval request for a declarative memory chunk that has the value ```=x``` in the slot ```first```. That is, we want to recall the successor of ```=x``` from memory.\n",

    "The ```\"increment\"``` rule below has preconditions involving the goal and retrieval buffers. It requires the value of ```count``` in the goal buffer to not match the final, ```end``` number (lines 4-5). This is achieved by specifying that ```count``` has the value ```=x``` and ```end``` does not have the same value (```~``` is negation). Second, the retrieval buffer carries a chunk whose ```first``` value matches the ```count``` value in the goal buffer. This condition will be satisfied if the retrieval request placed by the rule ```\"start\"``` succeeds. If these preconditions are satisfied, we trigger two actions (lines 11-16). First, the current ```count``` value will be updated to the value of its successor, which is the value stored in the ```second``` slot of the chunk in the retrieval buffer (lines 9 and 13). Second, we place a retrieval request for the next increment, i.e., the successor of the updated count (lines 14-16)."
